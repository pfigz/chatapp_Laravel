## Chat App

This project follows a tutorial by Scrypster. The front end is built with Vue. As with many YouTube tutorials, some packages have been updated and require slight alteration from the video if you are building from scratch. Additional commands for properly installing Pusher are included below. You will need to setup your own database, and you should already have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed prior to building this project.

- Scrypster's YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkRGJC0ytdU&t=3513s).

- Install [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation).

## Commands for Pusher Installation

```
composer require pusher/pusher-php-server
```
```
npm install --save laravel-echo pusher-js
```

The above commands are current as of this commit. They may differ depending upon your own configuration/setup.
